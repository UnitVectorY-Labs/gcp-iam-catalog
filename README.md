# gcp-iam-catalog

A comprehensive catalog of GCP IAM roles and permissions, designed to easily identify which roles include a specific permission.

Website: https://gcp-iam-catalog.unitvectorylabs.com/

## Overview

**gcp-iam-catalog** is a website that provides an organized and searchable catalog of GCP IAM roles and their associated permissions. The content is automatically generated by crawling the GCP IAM API, ensuring up-to-date and accurate information.

The rationale around providing this website is that the existing GCP documentation does not provide a simple way to search through the 1,700+ roles that exist in GCP.  Additionally, the 10,000+ permissions in GCP make it challenging to identify which roles grant specific permissions. This site aims to fill that gap.  It is possible that GCP may improve their documentation in the future, making this site obsolete. Until then it aims to provide a useful resource that is kept up to date automatically.

## How It Works

This application is written in Go for both the data collection and site generation processes. The workflow consists of the following steps:

1. **Data Collection:**
    - A GitHub Action [gcp-iam-catalog-crawl.yml](https://github.com/UnitVectorY-Labs/gcp-iam-catalog/blob/main/.github/workflows/gcp-iam-catalog-crawl.yml) runs weekly to crawl the GCP IAM API.
    - It fetches all IAM roles and their permissions, saving the data as JSON files in the repository under the [iam](https://github.com/UnitVectorY-Labs/gcp-iam-catalog/tree/main/iam) folder.
2. **Site Generation:**
    - Another GitHub Action [gcp-iam-catalog-generate.yaml](https://github.com/UnitVectorY-Labs/gcp-iam-catalog/blob/main/.github/workflows/gcp-iam-catalog-generate.yaml) triggers upon updates to the `main` branch.
    - It generates static HTML pages from the JSON data using the Go application.
    - Search functionality is implemented using JavaScript client-side.
    - The generated site is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages.
3. **Hosting:**
    - The website is hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Features

- **Role-to-Permission Mapping:** Easily view all permissions associated with each IAM role.
- **Permission-to-Role Mapping:** Identify all roles that grant a specific permission.
- **Automated Updates:** The catalog is updated weekly with the latest data from GCP.
- **Search Functionality:** Quickly search for roles or permissions within the catalog.
- **Hosted on GitHub Pages:** Accessible anytime without the need to run any application locally.
